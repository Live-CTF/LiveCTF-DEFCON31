Compiler challenges are so pass√©. Now we have linker challenges!
Don't bLink! This one is probably going fast...

It's literally just an arbitrary linker script challenge. You can tell LD where to put
the sections, and what to put in them. Apart from getting around the unwieldy syntax, the
solution steps (at least in the reference solution) are pretty straight forward:

- Make sure it generates a valid ELF (does this by default)
- Fill the TEXT segment with your shellcode
- Set the entry point to the start of your shellcode
- Make LD happy (impossible) (2023) (gone wild) (outdated meme)

I expect some team to basically have a solution for this pre-planned. I expect the first
solves to come in probably 10 minutes after opening (after they figure out how to interact).
It's not that outlandish of a concept and it wouldn't take that long to implement-- hell,
I was able to write _and_ solve it in less time than teams will have just to solve it.
